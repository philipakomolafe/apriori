# apriori
#During shopping online or watching movies, we often come around of some instances where we get recommendations 
#like - 'You might want to buy this item with that' or 'Movie Recommedation as per your liking' and we sometimes think how come the site knows about my liking.
#As funny as it seems, this is a prime example of Association Rule where algorithm finds relation between multiple item based on data inputs
#and helps to drive insights for big online shopping companies or Movie Channels which is also popularly known in real world as **Market - Basket Analysis**
